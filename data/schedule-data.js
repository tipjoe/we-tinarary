          "presenter": "Taylor Petrey",
          "description": "In order to understand the future of faith, we need to also understand its past and the present. A currently beleaguered faith is part of a broad paradigm shift in how we understand the nature of reality in the modern era. These challenges are not easily dismissed. At the same time, many, including Latter-day Saints, have undertaken the hard work of reconciling faith and modernity. But what about faith and post-modernity? How might faith contribute to the critique of modernity’s shortcomings, not through nostalgia for something lost, but as a paradigm for where to train our attention?",
