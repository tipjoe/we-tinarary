,111,200-A,,9:00:00 AM,10:00:00 AM,The Future of Faith,"In order to understand the future of faith, we need to also understand its past and the present. A currently beleaguered faith is part of a broad paradigm shift in how we understand the nature of reality in the modern era. These challenges are not easily dismissed. At the same time, many, including Latter-day Saints, have undertaken the hard work of reconciling faith and modernity. But what about faith and post-modernity? How might faith contribute to the critique of modernity’s shortcomings, not through nostalgia for something lost, but as a paradigm for where to train our attention?",Taylor Petrey,"Taylor Petrey is an associate professor of Religion at Kalamazoo College. He was Visiting Associate Professor of Women's Studies and Sexuality and Research Associate in the Women's Studies in Religion Program at Harvard Divinity School in 2016-17.

From ""Shhh, Be Still"" to Speaking Up—Remaking the Church Experience","After decades of feeling alone, I’d almost given up seeking a place for myself at church. When I accepted the calling to teach in a new ward, I wasn’t sure what I believed but I felt inspired to try building the space I needed into my lessons. I knew what I had found lacking, and what I longed for. After five years of consistently saying the things I need to hear at church, there’s been a transformation in our Relief Society. It seems the more I’m willing to speak my truth, the more I create space for others to do the same.",Susan M. Hinckley,"Susan M.

Mormon Theology and the Game of Thrones: Discerning the Difference between King-men and the Kingdom of God,"Both the Book of Mormon and the Game of Thrones present personal struggle against the backdrop of violent war narratives, differing only in level of explicit graphic detail. Both use the symbol of the steel sword as that which enforced good. Both are tragedies. The true heroes in both are those who are internally transformed away from the banality of the sword into personal nonviolence. In the vignettes of these heroes, whether Alma or the Hound, Ammon or Arya, Samuel, or the Red Woman, the futility of violence gives way to the personal transformation of the Kingdom of God within.",Mark Crego,"Mark Crego is the founder of the Identity Strategy foundation.

Isrealite Origins and Mormonism,"Aware of the growing number of LDS members exiting the Church the LDS hierarchy have responded to some of the cause with the Gospel Topic Essays; many of which focus on Mormon origins, but the problems with the traditional narrative is much larger. The biblical record of Isrealite origins is based primarily on myth presenting problems for literal beliefs of all religions that have grown out of the ancient Israelite traditions. Mormon theology centers on many of these origin myths such as the gathering of Israel. What does this all mean to the future of Mormonism and related traditions?",Ryan Wimmer,Ryan Wimmer received a BA in history from the University of Utah and an MA from BYU.

Mormon Poetry and the Prophetic Imagination: Opening (the) Faith Toward Possibility,"The prophetic imagination as a mode of consciousness disrupts mainstream cultural trends and seeks to expand individual and communal faith using language ripe with poetic rhythms and imagery. Whereas dogma intends to pin down and flatten out ideas and to narrow the conceptual frames through which people view the world, poetry relies on metaphor, nuance, ambiguity, and emotion to open audiences toward the abundance and possibilities of human knowledge, experience, relationships, organizations, and culture. In this session, five poets/editors consider the work of poetry and the prophetic imagination in the ongoing development of our Mormon faith community.",Tyler Chadwick; Dayna Patterson; Elizabeth Pinborough; Terresa Wellborn; Kathryn Knight Sonntag,"TYLER CHADWICK lives in Ogden, Utah with his wife, Jess, and their four daughters.

The Epistemology of Two Different Questions: What Do I Think Will Make Me Happy vs. What Is True?,"Many formerly faithful Mormons leave the church because it no longer makes them happy, or they discover it is not true, or both. They often face a spiritual crisis affecting their jobs, their relationships, their ethics, and their mental health. Sometimes they become confused and lose faith in their own ability to sort out what is good, true or real. This paper will explore ways of knowing what is good and true about the world including emotions, logic, reasoning and the evaluation of evidence.

NOW was upset at the LDS Church’s participation against the ERA and recruited and trained women and men to go door to door in the major cities of Utah on a program modeled after the LDS missionary program.

Burned Over, Burned Again, YET Never Burned Out: Four Perspectives on the Continuing Conversion Catastrophe","Two hundred years after Eric Hoffer’s True Believers found permanent and repetitive “purchase” along the fertile banks of what became the Erie Canal (before, during, & after its construction), the fires of faith (and subsequent “conversion”) simply would not stop re-kindling. Multiple movements that are still pulsing energetically today sprung up there. This presentation explores four contrasting views of why and draws relevant links to today’s polarized US Milieu/Melee.

But the decline in traditional religions does not result in a lack of appreciation for religious concepts like works, devotion, and self-improvement. The rise of video gaming represents a new interactive model for myth-making, the practice of works, and devotion. By looking at age-old religious tensions (such as the fraught relationship between works and grace) through the seemingly secular lens of games like Celeste, Cuphead, and Sekiro, we can gain new insights about these eternal questions.",Andrew Spriggs,"George Andrew Spriggs is a terrible gamer (that is, someone that more hardcore gamers might call a “filthy casual fake gamer”) and a nonbelieving, non-practicing cultural Mormon (that is, someone that true believing members of the LDS Church might call a “filthy casual fake Mormon” if they used gamer vocabulary.)

Abortion, pornography, gay marriage, as well as the decline of traditional families and the rise of out-of-marriage births led them to Republicanism; Utah non-Mormons, facing a seemingly permanent religious-political majority, became Democrats. LDS adherence to the old morality also affected Utah demography, making the state the youngest and most married. Decker’s new book, Utah Politics, changes the story of Utah history and shows how the state assimilated until the mid-1970s, when political and demographical changes reoccurred. Decker offers a new look at Utah history, politics, and government, one that highlights the importance of Latter-day Saint moral and family differences.",Rod Decker,"Rod Decker is known for his reporting on Utah’s KUTV Channel 2, as well as for his column and editorials in the Deseret News.

Perkins’s essay argues for inclusivity for LGBTQ+ communities without direct authority from LDS leadership. Peck’s essay incorporates existentialism as a way to bring about a spectrum of belief through subjectivity and an emphasis on meaningful choice.

Early Mormonism was tied directly to the land, be it the banks of the Susquehanna, Nauvoo, or the Salt Lake Valley. Sacred Land is an idea rooted deeply within the Mormon psyche. But that connection seems to be waning in modern Mormonism. This panel will discuss and explore the idea of Sacred Land within Mormonism— including rumination on how Mormonism has lost this land-ethic and why Mormonism needs to reclaim that land-ethic to confront both, our individual role in anthropogenic climate change, and to create a faith worthy of a more sustainable future",Rachael Lauritzen,"Søren Simonsen is the director of the Jordan River Commission, and an urban planner, architect, educator, community-builder and social entrepreneur.

The Only True and Living Church - A Case of Mood Confusion,A subjunctive statement in the Lord’s voice about the “only true and living church” (D&C 1:30) has been widely misunderstood as a statement of fact. Statements made as hopes or possibilities can be misunderstood as declarations. Mood confusion occurs when a statement made in one mood is understood to have been made in another mood and causes us to misunderstand God’s meaning and to misquote God. A basic understanding of the subjunctive mood can prevent us from mistaking an invitation from God for a divine endorsement of our present state before him.,McKay Lyman Platt,"McKay Platt is a medical doctor and surgeon, president of the Amasa Mason Lyman Historical Society (2003–2008), and author of Hear The Words of the Book-Big Precepts in the Book of Mormon You May Have Missed.
